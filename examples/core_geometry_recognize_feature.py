""" Loads a STEP file and identify geometrical nature of each face
(cylindrical face, planar etc.)
See github issue https://github.com/tpaviot/pythonocc-core/issues/470
Two options in this example:
1. Click any planar or cylindrical face from the 3d window. They will
be identified as known surfaces, their properties displayed in the
console
2. A batch mode : click the menu button. All the faces will be traversed
and analyzed
